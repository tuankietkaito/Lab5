QUESTION: What is the differences between Mutex and Spinlock?
ANSWER:
When multiple threads need to modify a shared resource such as a 
global variable, we typically lock the resource to guarantee at 
most one thread can do modification, such that a thread cannot 
interfere with other threads and leads to unexpected behaviors. 
Mutex and Spinlock are types of these locks.

MUTEX:
1. A thread tests for lock. If critical resources are available, 
the thread can use the resources. Otherwise, the thread goes to 
wait queue.
2. Used when the task can sleep while waiting for the lock.
3. Used when there will be considerable time before process gets 
the lock.

SPINLOCK:
1. A thread tests for lock. If critical resources are available, 
the thread can use the resources. Otherwise, it loops again and 
tests the lock till getting the lock.
2. Used when task canâ€™t sleep while waiting for the lock.
3. Used when lock will be granted in reasonably short time.
